	<description>ReGrowth is a mod deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Vanilla Expanded Series and the understanding how biomes work, what role they play in your game. Everything added was made to fit or mirror vanilla. From a simple UI texture to a new more complex system,being as performance and vanilla friendly is the main objective we have.

This module adds 11 new extinct animals to Rimworld, brought back to life with the wonders of genetic engineering. It is quite that simple actually. All of them fit perfectly into vanilla Rimworld and will spawn in their respective biomes, but are rarer than normal vanilla animals!
Interesting fact, dinosaur worlds are actually in Rimworlds lore! There is a planet called "Zoutera" that is classified as a Dino-world.

All of these lovely animals have been made as a commission by Erin, who is quite literally the queen of making Rimworld animals. Her work is amazing! Luizi gave some of them a slight touch up for the remastered version.

ReGrowth is designed to be as lightweight as possible, adding the minimum of new code required for its auditions to work.</description>
